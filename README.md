## Description

The Book Management System is a C++ project developed by a team of four students. It serves as a tool for librarians to manage book borrowing and return records, along with automatic due date calculations and late return alerts.

## Features

- Login System: The librarian must provide login credentials to access the system.

- Student Book Borrowing: The system records the details of students who borrow books.

- Due Date Generation: The system automatically generates the due date for each borrowed book.

- Late Return Alerts: If a student returns a book after the due date, the system provides a late return alert.

- Object-Oriented Programming: The project is implemented using OOP principles, incorporating all four paradigms.

- Data Storage: Data is stored using the filesystem library, utilizing text files for record keeping.

## Libraries Used

The project uses the following C++ libraries:

- `iostream`: For standard input and output.
- `iomanip`: For formatting output.
- `fstream`: For reading and writing to files.
- `bits/stdc++.h`: A convenient header that includes most standard C++ libraries.
- `string`: For string manipulation.
- `time.h`: For time-related functionalities.
- `windows.h`: For Windows-specific functions (optional, platform-dependent).

## Getting Started

To run the Book Management System, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Compile the C++ source files using a C++ compiler (e.g., g++).
3. Run the executable to launch the program.
